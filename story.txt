Once upon a time there was person in a story.x

This person lived in a black world, surrounded by ghostly figures. The looked green and was a bit 
of a square, always on the run from these ghostly figures. No matter how much distance they covered 
the figures were always one step behind. But one day green, realized that they weren't running from 
the figures, green was leading them, almost commanding them to follow behind green. But where were they going?

Green continued to walk, wondering what to do next. Should Green continue to lead the ghosts? Communicate with them? 
Try and get away from them? Finally, Green decided it was time to figure out what the ghost's were after. He travelled
across the black world looking for answers, when finally there was one. A man who was able to communicate with these
ghostly figures. When Green asked the man why the ghosts were following him, he was not expecting the answer he received.

The man said "It's because you are the chosen one. You are the chosen one to free the ghosts by retrieving a green stone 
that is in his house. Then you have to say something meaningful to free the ghosts from being trapped in the dark world."
As soon as the man told him this, Green started running to his house to find the stone. It took him a day but he found 
the stone underneath his bed. But he realized he had to say something meaningful and he had no idea. Then suddenly he 
knew what to say.
