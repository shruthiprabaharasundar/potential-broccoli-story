Once upon a time there was person in a story.x

This person lived in a black world, surrounded by ghostly figures. The looked green and was a bit 
of a square, always on the run from these ghostly figures. No matter how much distance they covered 
the figures were always one step behind. But one day green, realized that they weren't running from 
the figures, green was leading them, almost commanding them to follow behind green. But where were they going?
