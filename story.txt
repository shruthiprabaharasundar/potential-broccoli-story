Once upon a time there was person in a story.x

This person lived in a black world, surrounded by ghostly figures. The looked green and was a bit 
of a square, always on the run from these ghostly figures. No matter how much distance they covered 
the figures were always one step behind. But one day green, realized that they weren't running from 
the figures, green was leading them, almost commanding them to follow behind green. But where were they going?

Green continued to walk, wondering what to do next. Should Green continue to lead the ghosts? Communicate with them? 
Try and get away from them? Finally, Green decided it was time to figure out what the ghost's were after. He travelled
across the black world looking for answers, when finally there was one. A man who was able to communicate with these
ghostly figures. When Green asked the man why the ghosts were following him, he was not expecting the answer he received.
